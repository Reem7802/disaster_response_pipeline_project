# disaster_response_pipeline_project

this repository show you a machine learning pipeline to categorize events.

.

# Libraries used:

The following python libraries were used in this project.
json, plotly, pandas, joblib, re, nltk, flask, sqlalchemy, sys, pickle, sklearn

.

# Running the code:

From the project folder run run.py to start the dash application

.


# Project Motivation:

For this project, i Built a machine learning pipeline to categorize  events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency including a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.

.

# File Description:

process_data.py
disaster_categories.csv: message categories dataset
disaster_messages.csv: messages dataset
DisasterResponse.db: cleaned db to train the model
train_classifier.py 
classifier.pkl: trained model
run.py
templates


.

# Summary:

in this project we Built a machine learning pipeline to categorize  events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency, provided by a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events.
